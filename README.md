🌦️ Weather App

📄 Project Description
This is a responsive Weather App built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a RESTful Weather API. The application allows users to search for real-time weather information by entering a city name. The app fetches data from an external weather API and displays current temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind speed, and an icon representing the weather status.

🔧 Technologies Used
HTML – for the basic structure of the application

CSS – for styling and responsive layout

JavaScript – for API integration, DOM manipulation, and interactivity

RESTful API – (e.g., OpenWeatherMap API) to fetch real-time weather data
